# GitHub Repositories Search App

This app uses [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#search-repositories) to search through repositories based on input from the user. The results are rendered on a table.

## Getting Started

> If you will be using any other package manager remember to `DELETE` the `package-lock.json` file at the root directory.
